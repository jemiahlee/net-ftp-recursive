Revision history for Perl extension Net::FTP::Recursive.

1.0  Tue Jan 21 09:08:15 2003
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.22 with options
		-X -v 1.0 -n Net::FTP::Recursive

1.1  Added rdir and rls methods.

1.4 Added code to handle symlinks a little better.

1.5  -Fixed bug that caused an infinite loop when a directory was unreachable.
     -Added rdelete method.
     -Added RemoveRemoteFiles and RemoveLocalFiles options.
     
1.6 
    -Fixed problems on some platforms where empty directories would
     cause problems.  Specifically, an undef would get passed around
     and cause havoc when methods were called on them.  Seen only on
     Windows platforms, as far as I know.
    -Fixed a bug with symlinks, where a symlink referring to a directory
     would not take you back to the original directory when doing a 
     cdup.  Now it manually retrieves the path first and cwd's back
     to that dir.
    -Added code to test for cycles and to be smart and make symlinks
     wherever possible.  This is only used when the SymlinkFollow option
     to rget is used.  It obviously will not be fully functional under
     Windows (no symlinks), but the cycle elimination should work.
    -Added options for allowing for the matching or omission
     of certain filenames.
    -Added code to make sure that files accessed through a
     symlink will not be deleted if RemoveRemoteFiles is
     set.  If the files will be deleted elsewhere in the
     tree via a directory, then they will obviously still be
     deleted.
